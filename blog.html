                        <p class="text">Have you ever imagined why Jaipur is named as the Pink City? The reason is that
                            the sunset of the place and the sunrise gives a pink shade on the sky which is so beautiful.
                            There are many famous markets in Jaipur like Johari Bazaar, Tripolia Bazaar, Chandpol
                            Bazaar. All the markets grab the color they have been named with during a particular phase
                            of the day, which truly justifies the name.</p>
